- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Tin Man's Repo's - @tinmansgit

NOT a programmer! I create scripts to solve problems I encounter or<br />
create solutions that I can't find in the FOSS world to fit a specific<br />
requirement. They are not what I would call Drop In scripts. But you can<br />
mod then to fit your needs.
